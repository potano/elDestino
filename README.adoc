= El Destino
Toolkit to generate an interactive map

Displays the El Destino plantation in Jefferson County, Florida,
the Bellamy Road, and various Spanish mission sites.

Uses the Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com) Javascript library to display
the map.  Uses Open Streetmap (https://osm.org) tiles as a base layer.

Build system requires

- a Make utility (GNU Make tested)
- a POSIX shell (Bash ver 5.1 tested)
- GNU coreutils
- _misiones_ tool available from https://github.com/potano/misiones


Features to be displayed on the map are determined by the contents of the
files in the data/ directory.  The files are in a format based on Lisp
S-Expressions; the filename extension is _.sexp_.  The build processor
reads these files to generate a _data.js_ file which the client-side
application reads in preparation to generate the map.

Look to the documentation of the _misiones_ tool for information on using
the tool and the format of the data files it processes.
